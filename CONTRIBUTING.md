> __Staff and Repo Collaborators__: Please only push to `develop` when changes are ready to publish. The `develop` branch is intended only as a last check to see edits live on the web in a production type build environment before publishing—changes shouldn't sit on the `develop` branch for long before pushing to `master`.

## Adding/Editing Images

If you would like to add, edit or replace images you are welcome to do so. There are a couple optimization steps we require:
* make sure the image is scales down to an appropriate physical size
* Only images that require a transparent background (alpha channel) should be PNGs, all others should be JPGs
° optimize images using ImageOptim before you upload

You can host the image in the [`/src` folder](https://github.com/postmanlabs/covid-19-apis/tree/develop/src/images) of this project.

**Note**:

Images hosted by Postman should always be referenced as follows:

``` bash

```

## Algolia

Please note that Algolia search will not work when running the app locally. If you wish to search when running the app locally, you are welcome to use your own Algolia API keys and index the app in your own Algolia account. You can find an env.example file in the repo that shows you what keys you require to run Algolia search.

## Run checks locally

* npm run test  -> runs the Unit testing
* npm run test:mdlint -> runs the Markdownlinter
* npm run test:lint -> runs the ESlinter
* npm run test:url -> checks if acceptable image URL has been added
